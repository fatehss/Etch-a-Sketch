# Etch-a-Sketch

This is an etch-a-sketch in DOM. I've added a few features to make the sketching more interesting for the user, such as 

> Drop-down color picker

> Variable canvas size on the page

> Variable grid size (amount of pixels in the grid)

> Grid lines that you can turn on and off - something I always like on drawing applications

Reflections:

All in all I thought this was a fun exercise to get my feet wet with DOM. Once I got the basic sketch part running (easy once I got used to the roundabout way that HTML-CSS-Javascript work together), adding new features became pretty easy. 

Some masterpieces:
